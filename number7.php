                <h2 style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Number 7’s Distinctive Qualities in Numerology.</h2>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Lets take a look at number 7. Pythagoras, the Great Father of Mathematics and Numerology, saw number Seven as a profoundly spiritual number.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">The number 7 metaphorically depicts the movement of kundalini from the bottom of the spine to the third eye in the centre of the forehead between the eyes. It is fashioned like a shepherd’s crook. In mystical traditions, the third eye is known as Tisra Til, or the Tenth Gate. It is the hidden entrance to the inner realms.</p>
                 <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">People born on the 7th, 16th, or 25th of any month, or whose date of birth totals seven, are profound, introspective, intuitive, private, reclusive, secret, separate, remote, and indifferent to the outward world of phenomena but not to the inner realms of secrets, intrigue, and hidden mysteries. Seven is analytical, inquisitive, perfectionist, and frequently critical. It wonders why and journeys within to find out. Those that want to discover the inner mysteries of life, the cosmos, and the universe have seven very active vibrational frequencies in their vibration matrix.</p> 
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Its spiritual frequency contains seven vibrations: sensitive, refined, restrained, dignified, quiet, modest, peaceful, tranquil, serene, pure, and chaste. The Seven is the path to spiritual awareness because it is patient, mystical, insightful, and, eventually, self-realized. Seven goes away from the outward world of manifestations and commercialism and devotes itself, via meditation and prayer, to the inner realms of mystical illumination to discover Him–often painfully but never reluctantly.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Seven represents humanity’s profound inner longing for depth, purpose, and spiritual connection. When the creature’s basic requirements for nourishment, self-expression, and material and domestic accomplishments have been fulfilled, we move to the higher levels of existence to study, educate ourselves, and discover meaning. They are an investigator and an innovator who need isolation in order to hear their inner voice. Sevens are unique, quirky, or loners who are extremely selective in all aspects.</p>
                <h2 style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Number 7 is ruled by Ketu.</h3>
                <p  style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">In Vedic Numerology, corresponds to the moonie’s south node. Ketu. It is commonly known as a “shadow” planet. Ketu is considered malevolent and has been related with unpleasant events. Most people see it as a challenging planet since it causes several problems on the material realm. It frequently causes feelings of alienation, loss, mindlessness, wandering, and confusion in one’s life.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">The essence of number, as the south node of the moon (Number 2), is diametrically opposed to the traits of no.2. When he is prominent or active, he has a tendency to make nature sensual and dreamlike. When they are passive, they have a strong proclivity to defraud. Without a question, he is a villain to the majority. He enjoys immersing himself in his own fantasy world. The two extremes of this number are sometimes linked and sometimes scattered. These people are tough to understand because they have buried secrets. They are skilled at reading people’s minds. They are deeply involved in religious activities. They like seclusion and appreciate hearing words of praise.</p>
                <h2 style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Number 7 Love & Relationships in Numerology</h2>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">When it comes to romantic relationships, these people take their partners and their relationships very seriously. Ladies of this number do not flaunt their affection, but they have true love in their hearts. Because of their oversensitivity, some of them do not marry and live an unmarried life. When they do marry, it is commonly noticed that they marry into wealthy households. This group of people care deeply for the children they have and care less about the youngsters around them. They are typically quite happy in their marriages and families.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">These people don’t seem to make many friends, but the ones they do have are the best for them. They are often introverts who get along well with intellectuals or those who can manage challenging situations for and with them. They dislike acquiring money or, more accurately, they are unable to save. They like regular travel and spend the most of their time travelling, particularly to foreign nations.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">They also lack good people skills and want to be left alone, making interactions tough at all levels. This affects how they communicate and cope with other people’s ideas and opinions.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">The majority of people experience issues with their relationships and friends. They experience difficulty in their marriages and frequently divorce. Number 7 has difficult partnerships, and Ketu’s energy always prevents the right marriage from occurring. Even if they marry, the marriage will be hampered by family and other influences.</p>
                <h2 style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Numerology for 7 in Career, Jobs, and Professions</h2>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">It has also been found that these persons choose only careers that allow them to fly or are based in other countries. Their key distinguishing feature is their ability to make independent judgements. They do not operate under extreme pressure, and no one can tell them what to do. Whatever they do has an element of freshness to it. They are generous folks who live a joyful and rich life. They seldom enjoy success, and if they do, it is usually after a lot of hard work, hardship, and disappointment. They are always striving for notoriety and achievement. They experience a lot of failure and disappointment. Despite their determination, knowledge, and insight, many people work in unsatisfying professions and fail to advance in their careers.</p>
               
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Professions that fit them include teacher, philosopher, actor, or anything else that does not need excellence. Diseases that affect them are associated with the ‘Adrenal’ gland. In general, they have issues with digestion, kidney, blood circulation, ovary, Fallopian tube, and uterine. These disorders are caused by emotional stress or hypertension, both of which restrict the solar plexus. They have the ability to think, but this occasionally goes beyond what it should, which is why certain disorders exist. If they can manage their minds, they will be able to recover from their illnesses.</p>
                <P style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">As a malevolent planet, a name rectification for a number 7 is a difficult operation.</P>
                <h2>The Remedies for Number 7’s are</h2>
                <ul><li>A Victory Name correction</li></ul>
                <ul><li>A Ketu numerological yantra</li></ul>
                <ul><li>A gemstone which repels the Ketu influence.</li></ul>

                <h2 style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-weight;bold;">Traits Number 7 Should Try to Improve</h2>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Being too critical of oneself may backfire in all of your relationships, even the one you have with yourself. Being opinionated is not incorrect, but being a know-it-all in every case may not work. This also applies to their forthright communication, in which they refuse to filter things and tell them as they are, which others may find difficult to accept. In numerology, the 7 number represents someone who is quite separated from others, which might lead to misunderstandings in their social life.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Furthermore, your overwhelming preference for your own independence might sometimes cause you to be less kind, making you dislikeable. People with the numerology number 7 must learn to adapt to changing circumstances in order to avoid unneeded fights and issues.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Number 7 must make a genuine effort to interact without being inflexible in order to provide balance and harmony to partnerships and other social groupings. Keeping your personal space as home and workplace decluttered can also provide you with much-needed relaxation and a break from being intuitive and introspective all of the time.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">People who live in residences that add up to number 7 must also adhere to a few requirements in order to keep the property’s feel good and balanced.</p>
                <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size;16px;">Houses with the number 7 might provide you with a peaceful atmosphere and a tranquil air. Those seeking for retirement or holiday residences should go for number 7. Residents of residences that sum up to number 7 might also expect a spiritual bent. However, if you want to flourish in your work and have lofty ambitions, the number 7 houses may not be for you because they are all about peace and meditative features.</p>
