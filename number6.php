                <h3 >Number 6 According to Numerology</h3>
                <p >Everyone must learn to offer and receive the beauty of harmony, sympathy, understanding, compassion, protection, and balance in this cosmos.</p>
                <p >In addition to these things, people must understand their Responsibilities towards Love and Family in order for relationships to remain beautiful and continue longer. This stage of life corresponds to Number 6 in the Numerology number sequence. Isn’t it remarkable how a single number can express so much about our lives? That is the beauty of Numerology!</p>
                <p >The most prominent ancient numerology theory is Pythagorean Numerology, which is extensively utilised and acknowledged. The famous philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, the father and founder of this system, believes that this number represents love and family duties. This is a combination of socialisation, sophistication, bravado, wants, and money. Their lives revolve on their wants, dreams, and diplomacy.</p>

                <h3 >Number 6 in Numerology</h3>
                <p >Venus rules the number six. You are pleasant, loving, and have an appealing personality that draws others to you. It attracts all the nice things in life. You adore luxury and have been endowed with a high reputation, fame, and wealth. If you aren’t getting any of this, your Venus is being repressed by a negative number, and only a name correction may reverse the malefic consequences.</p>
                <p >The number 6 has various connotations and is connected to a hexagon, which has six sides. The Vedas are divided into six branches in Indian mythology. There are six seasons in Indian. This number causes one to be committed and dedicated to the family, but it also causes one to get overloaded with duties. They are generally surrounded by women in their homes and social groups. They imagine an environment, strive hard to obtain it, and their entire lives revolve around it. They are generally family people, although they dislike the following customs. They may be interested in hidden knowledge such as tantra, witchcraft, black magic, and the occult as well.</p>
                <p >The number 6 is also known as a ‘Mother’ (feminine traits) and is primarily a working, construction number. It represents significant household/family obligation and service, which must be accomplished by love, caring, and protection. The six people have a natural desire to provide harmony, peace, justice, and truth to all of their life experiences. 6 is drawn to beauty and requires comfort in all aspects of their existence – emotionally, spiritually, and physically.</p>
                <p>As a number six, you tend to get more than you offer. Others will donate to you, serve you, and labour for you, and you will eventually live a luxury life. Some number sixes take work from others. Most number 6s attract affluent partners and enjoy prosperity as a result of their rich husband or wife.</p>
                <p >When number 6 is combined with a negative name number, 7 or 8, it might cause you to be dishonest and take advantage of others.</p>
                <p>You were born lucky as a number six.</p>
                <p >Venus is associated with the number 6 in Vedic numerology. This planet, commonly called as the morning star, is the brightest in the eastern sky before daybreak. It is a feminine and aquatic planet that represents all that is lovely and sumptuous in the earth. As a feminine planet, it is also associated with feminism and women.</p>
                <p>Number 6 depicts a magical creature with a flat curving head and a rolled-up bottom. This demonstrates their diverted attention, and the rolled bottom demonstrates a great demand for pleasure. A person who is willing to go to any length to satisfy his demands and has a great drive to achieve anything.</p>
               <p >Those born on the 6th, 15th, or 24th of any month, or whose date of birth reduces to 6, are number 6 persons. They are full of energy and enthusiasm. They enjoy wearing stylish clothing. They avoid disorderly things and are very interested in aesthetic things. Six is a caring, compassionate, lovely, and serene number. Their feelings are frequently idealistic, and their romance incorporates spiritual elevation. Sexual enjoyment is less important to these folks.</p>
                <p >This group of men are drawn to attractive women. They might be quite attractive and flawless in appearance. This quantity of women makes the physique rather nicely set and plump. They can have a round face, a beautiful complexion, rolling eyes, a well-shaped, dimpled face, a charming voice, and a love of music, love, and romance. They can be the most beautiful creatures we’ve ever seen, as well as the most enticing.</p>

                <h3 >Number 6 & The Aesthetic Connection</h3>
                <p>Their houses are as lovely as they are. They lavishly furnish their home and transform it into a royal palace. Their spirits are satisfied by music and the arts. They like entertaining those that are linked with them. They are natural counsellors who like assisting others in need. They are there for everyone, whether they are moving, sick, looking for companionship, or simply looking for someone to hang out with. If they become aware that someone they know is stressed, they will do all in their power to relieve the tension. They are generally the leaders in their buddy groups and may be a solid friend to rely on.</p>
                <h3 >Number 6 People are Magnetic</h3>
                <p >Without a doubt, their attraction draws people, but it also attracts bad individuals. They may fall victim to the malicious intentions of others and incur significant losses. They have a vulnerability in that they cannot be alone, which is presumably why they are always looking for companionship. Love is a key component in their life because it is the source of the majority of their difficulties. It has also been found that the majority of persons with the number 6 have troubled marriages. The majority of these folks are also obstinate and envious. They may also be quite passionate and envious if they are offended.</p>
                <p >They like creating a welcoming environment at home, and their children adore them. These folks, like everyone else, experience fluctuations and internal problems. They may, however, manipulate and constantly strive to be joyful even after the disorders, keep the hopes alive no matter what occurs or how difficult life is for them.</p>
                <h3  >Number 6 Career & Businesses</h3>
                <p >Musicians, singers, painters, jewellers, beauticians, and models, for example, are suitable professions for them. They often earn a lot of money but are unable to save much of it. Their spending habits are awful, which may put them in financial difficulty. The ailments from which they suffer the most are pituitary-related. It regulates the growth of bones, lipids, digestion, sugar or diabetes, genitals, and urine.</p>
